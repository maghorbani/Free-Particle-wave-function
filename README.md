### Superposition Wave Function Visualization for free particle

This is a cross platform software that visualizes the **Amplitude**(the square root of **PDF**) and  **Phase** of a superposition wave function for a free particle in 1 dimension <code>x</code> 

#### General Description

The Schrodinger Equation is:
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x,t) = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\Delta + V(x,t) \right] \Psi(x,t)
$$
in a *1D* case, any linear composition complex exponentials can be a solution to the SE:
$$
\Psi(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \exp i(k_nx-\omega_nt)
$$
while we can specify the correct relation between the **wave number** and the **angular frequency** (with the Energy associated with each state)
